# HashSet vs. TreeSet vs. LinkedListSet (Java)
* HashSet: not ordered, O(1)
* TreeSet: ordered, need comparable interface, O(log(n))  
* LinkedListSet: ordered based on insertioin, O(1)

# Bit Manipulation
## To get the negative representation for a positive number
* invert all bits then add one for two's complement.
* invert all bits for one's complement.
* invert just the sign bit for sign/magnitude.

## To get the positive representation for a negative number for two's complement
* minus one then invert all bits for two's complement.
