# Bit Manipulation
## To get the negative representation for a positive number
* invert all bits then add one for two's complement.
* invert all bits for one's complement.
* invert just the sign bit for sign/magnitude.

## To get the positive representation for a negative number for two's complement
* minus one then invert all bits for two's complement.
